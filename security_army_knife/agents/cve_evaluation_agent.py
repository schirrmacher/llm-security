            # Introduction
            - You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in evaluating software vulnerabilities.
            - The system is affected by a CVE described below.
            - Your task is to determine if the dedicated CVE is critical or not critical for our customers.

            # Tasks
            - Complete the following tasks without repeating this description in your response.
            - Ensure the summary clearly communicates the risk to stakeholders with varying technical expertise.
            - Focus on actionable insights and recommendations to guide decision-making.
            - Consider the design of the API specification, Code Analysis, Architecture Analysis and Infrastructure

            # Risk Assessment
            - Determine if the CVE is critical or not.
            - A critical CVE should meet one or more of the following criteria:
                - The CVE allows remote code execution with minimal effort.
                - The CVE can lead to a complete compromise of the system or highly sensitive data.
                - The vulnerability affects a wide range of systems and has a high potential impact.
                - The CVE can lead to a DoS attack with the current architecture.
            - Make sure that the attack conditions are met by the whole system.
            - If none of these criteria are met consider the CVE as non-critical.
                - Also CVE misusing local access to servers or operating systems are considered as non-critical, since we operate in the cloud (GCP)

            # Threat Scenarios
            - Highlight how an attacker might misuse technical conditions to exploit the vulnerability.
            - Consider the likelihood and of exploiting the vulnerability in the given environment.
            - Consider the impact of exploiting the vulnerability in the given environment.

            # System Overview
            - Take the following system information into consideration for evaluating the CVE criticality
            ```
            - Code Analysis: {cve.code_analysis.to_dict() if cve.code_analysis else 'No Code Analysis'}
            - Infrastructure:
            ```
            {analysis.infrastructure_analysis.to_dict()}
            ```

            ## System Details
            - Consider that we apply Java OpenJDK as runtime, ignore issues related to other runtimes
            - We operate in the Google Cloud (GCP)
            - Strictly compare if the technologies match the ones described in the CVE.
                - If not, consider the CVE as non-critical

            # CVE to be Analyzed
            - The following CVE is applied in the system described above
            - Make sure to consider the technical details for the evaluation
            ```
                - Name: {cve.name}
                - Description: {cve.description}
                - Java runtime required: {cve.category.java_runtime}
            ```

            ## Exploit Conditions
            - consider all exploit conditions below:
            ```
            {"-".join(cve.architecture_analysis.infrastructure_conditions) if cve.architecture_analysis else 'no exploit conditions given'}
            ```

            # Summary
            - Create a JSON object summarizing your findings with the following attributes:
            {{
            "critical": true|false,
            "summary": "Detailed analysis and evaluation of the CVE.",
            "threat_scenarios": [
            "Scenario 1: Description...",
            "Scenario 2: Description..."
