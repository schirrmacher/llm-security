The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data.

This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.

These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable.

If policy processing is enabled, attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The API specification includes endpoints that handle X.509 certificate chains, making the system a potential target. The architecture analysis confirms that components such as the InboundGateway, AquirerGateway, and TokenizationService within the PCI GKE Cluster handle X.509 certificate chains. Mutual TLS (MTLS) is used for secure communication, and the HSM and Terminals also rely on OpenSSL for certificate verification. Although strict network segmentation and firewall policies are in place, the potential impact on system availability is significant if policy processing is enabled.",

Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via TLS to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition.  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data as well as  unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs.

Successful exploitation can result in unauthorized creation, deletion, or modification of critical data, as well as unauthorized access to sensitive data. The vulnerability is difficult to exploit but has a high impact on confidentiality and integrity. The affected versions are Oracle Java SE: 8u361, 8u361-perf, 11.0.18, 17.0.6, 20; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.9, 21.3.5, and 22.3.1. The API specification analysis indicates that the endpoints handling sensitive credit card data are potential targets. The architecture analysis shows that the infrastructure conditions, including the use of affected Java versions and network access via TLS, contribute to the risk. Despite strict network segmentation and firewall policies, the potential for remote code execution and the high impact on sensitive data make this CVE critical.",

The vulnerability impacts Apache Tomcat versions 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10, 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.15, 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.82, and 8.5.0 through 8.5.95. The potential impact on the CIA triad includes a compromise of confidentiality and integrity, as an attacker could manipulate requests to access unauthorized data. The availability may also be affected if the system becomes unstable due to malformed requests. Given the strict network segmentation and firewall policies, the risk is somewhat mitigated, but the vulnerability remains exploitable due to the nature of the reverse proxy configuration. The architecture analysis indicates that the affected Tomcat instances are part of the 'Team Flipper Java Micro-services' within the PCI GKE Cluster, which increases the risk. It is recommended to upgrade to the patched versions of Apache Tomcat to mitigate this vulnerability.",

This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.",
