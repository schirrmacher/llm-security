‚ùå,CVE-2022-1471,False/True,low/high,Service does not parse YAML files from untrusted sources.,"The vulnerability allows for remote code execution when deserializing untrusted YAML content. This can lead to an attacker executing arbitrary code on the targeted system. In the context of a Java microservice deployed in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) via a container, an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the container or even the underlying host system. This could result in a compromise of the entire cluster if appropriate security measures are not in place."
‚ùå,CVE-2023-34053,True/False,high/low,Vulnerable dependency is used which can lead to DoS attacks.,"The vulnerability allows for a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, which can make the application unavailable to its intended users. This can lead to significant disruption, especially in a production environment. The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted HTTP requests, which means it can potentially be exploited from the public internet if the application is exposed. However, the application is deployed in a containerized environment (GKE), which can provide some level of isolation and may limit the impact of a successful DoS attack. Additionally, the use of Java Eclipse Temurin, an open-source build of OpenJDK, may also have security benefits, as it is regularly updated and patched. If the API performs solid sanitization and only accepts described formats and files, it might be more difficult for an attacker to craft the special HTTP request needed to trigger the vulnerability. This could significantly reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit."
‚úÖ,CVE-2023-34054,True/True,high/High,Vulnerable dependency is used which can lead to DoS attacks.,"The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by sending specially crafted HTTP requests. This can lead to the unavailability of the service, which is a significant impact, especially for applications that rely on high availability. The vulnerability is in the Reactor Netty HTTP Server, which is a commonly used library, and it affects multiple versions, increasing the likelihood of exploitation."
üü°,CVE-2023-4911,False/False,low/Medium-Low,We do not assume a local attacker in the container.,"This is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the GNU C Library's dynamic loader ld.so. It could allow a local attacker to execute code with elevated privileges by using maliciously crafted GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variables when launching binaries with SUID permission. However, in the context of a Java microservice deployed in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) via a container, the severity might be reduced as the vulnerability is less likely to be exploited. This is because it primarily affects the GNU C Library, which is not directly used by Java applications running in containers. Furthermore, the use of Java Eclipse Temurin and solid API sanitization may also reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited."
üü°,CVE-2023-6246,False/False,low/medium,An attacker using the API with proper sanitization is not able to create a log which exceeds the length. Additionally syslog and vsyslog is not used by the Java microservice.,"This vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow issue in the glibc library. It can potentially lead to application crashes or local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. However, in the context of a Java microservice deployed in GKE via a container, the severity might be lowered. Java applications typically don't directly interact with the glibc library, and the containerized environment provides additional security measures. Furthermore, if the API performs solid sanitization, it would be harder for an attacker to trigger the vulnerability."
‚ùå,CVE-2023-6378,False/True,medium/high,An attacker using the API with proper sanitization is not able to create a maliciously crafted log message.,"The vulnerability is a serialization issue in the logback receiver component of logback version 1.4.11. Serialization vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker to send specially crafted data that, when deserialized, can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition. DoS attacks can cause significant disruption to the availability of a service. Considering the additional information about the deployment environment, the severity could potentially be increased to Critical if the microservice is exposed to the public internet or can be accessed from another container. This is because the attack surface is larger, and the likelihood of exploitation is higher. However, the use of Java Eclipse Temurin, which is known for its security features, could potentially mitigate some of the risk. Challenging the analysis with the API specification, if the API performs solid sanitization and only accepts described formats and files, the severity could potentially be downgraded to Medium. This is because the likelihood of successfully exploiting the vulnerability is reduced if the API can effectively sanitize user input and prevent malicious data from reaching the vulnerable component. However, it's important to note that even with input sanitization, the vulnerability still exists and could potentially be exploited under certain conditions. Therefore, it's recommended to update the logback component to a version where the vulnerability has been patched."
‚ùå,CVE-2024-20918,False/True,low/high,We do not apply Oracle Java SE. We apply Java Eclipse Temurin.,"The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, and Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, leading to unauthorized creation, deletion, or modification of critical data. The application is a Java microservice deployed in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) via a container, which adds an additional layer of security. Additionally, the use of Java Eclipse Temurin, an open source Java SE build based upon OpenJDK, may also provide additional security benefits. However, the vulnerability can still be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, and the use of solid sanitization and acceptance of only described formats and files in the API spec may not be enough to fully mitigate the vulnerability. If an attacker can trigger an exploit from the public internet or from another container, the severity of the vulnerability would remain high."
‚úÖ,CVE-2019-15504,False/False,low/low,USB driver not relevant for a cloud application.,"This is a double free vulnerability in the Linux kernel that can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service (DoS), or escalate privileges. However, it is specific to the USB subsystem and typically requires local access or a specific setup to be exploited."
‚ùå,CVE-2018-5703,False/True,low/high,,A vulnerability in the Linux kernel that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially have other unspecified impacts due to an out-of-bounds write in the tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock function.
‚ùå,CVE-2021-22600,True/False,high/Medium,"Since a packet socket is affected, remote attackers might send malicious requests.","A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's nft_object. Use-after-free vulnerabilities can lead to unpredictable behavior, including memory corruption and code execution, which can result in privilege escalation. However, in this specific context, the application is a Java microservice deployed in GKE via a container, which provides an additional layer of isolation. Additionally, there is no local privilege escalation, the attacker would need to trigger the exploit from the public internet or from another container, and the application uses Java Eclipse Temurin, which is based on OpenJDK and regularly updated. Taking all of this into account, the severity of this vulnerability could be downgraded to Medium or even Low, depending on other factors such as the sensitivity of the data handled by the application and the potential impact of a successful attack."
‚úÖ,CVE-2016-8735,True/True,high/high,"When the Java Management Extension (JMX) port is open, the application is vulnerable.","This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, which is one of the most serious types of vulnerabilities. If an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a system, they can potentially gain full control of it, steal data, or cause other types of damage. The targeted application is a Java microservice deployed in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) via a container. The use of Java Eclipse Temurin, an open source Java SE build based upon OpenJDK, does not necessarily change the severity. However, if the API performs solid sanitization and only accepts described formats and files, the severity could potentially be lowered. Without knowing the specifics of the API implementation and whether the used Java build is vulnerable, the severity is maintained as high."
‚úÖ,CVE-2021-45046,True/True,high/high,This vulnerability leads to remote code execution when attacker is able to inject malicious log information.,This vulnerability allows for both information leaks and remote code execution in certain environments. It affects a widely used logging library like Log4j and can be exploited through control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data.
